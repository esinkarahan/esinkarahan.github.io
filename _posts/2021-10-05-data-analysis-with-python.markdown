I have completed [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-projects) projects and obtained the certificate for data analysis that is equivalent to 300 hours training.

Projects are:

1. [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/esinkarahan/data_analysis_with_python/tree/main/demographic-data-analyzer)
2. [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/esinkarahan/data_analysis_with_python/tree/main/demographic-data-analyzer)
3. [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/esinkarahan/data_analysis_with_python/tree/main/medical-data-visualizer)
 Counts of good and bad outcomes for the cholesterol, gluc, alco, active, and smoke variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0:

 Correlations between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices:

4. [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/esinkarahan/data_analysis_with_python/tree/main/page-view-time-series-visualizer)
 Daily page views of freeCodeCamp Forum from 2016 to 2020:
 ![page_views](/assets/images/line_plot.png)
 Daily page views are distributed within a given year or month and it is compared over time: 
 ![box_plot](/assets/images/box_plot.png)
 Average daily page views for each month grouped by year:
 ![bar_plot](/assets/images/bar_plot.png)
5. [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/esinkarahan/data_analysis_with_python/tree/main/sea-level-predictor)
 How would be the sea level in 2050 based on data since 1880 or 2000?
