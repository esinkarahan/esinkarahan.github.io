Hi, there! I am Esin. I am a postdoctoral research fellow in [Cardiff University Brain Imaging Centre](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/cardiff-university-brain-research-imaging-centre). 

I received my BSc degree in [electrical-electronics engineering](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/) from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey and completed MSc and PhD degrees in [Biomedical Engineering Institute](http://www.bme.boun.edu.tr/) of the same university. During my PhD I worked on the integration of EEG-fMRI signals on the cortical surface by decomposing the signals of these modalities on the common and discrimininant subspaces with higher order dimensional methods (tensor). I visited [Prof Pedro Valdes-Sosa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0M2PVJIAAAAJ) in Cuban Neuroscience Center to develop Granger Causality methods for the quantification of the brain connectivity over higher number of nodes with tensor regression. Later, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the newly founded [Neuroinformatics-Collaboratory](https://www.neuroinformatics-collaboratory.org/) in UESTC, Chengdu China with Pedro Valdes-Sosa. In this time I was interested in developing biophysically plausible state-space models for investigating the brain connectivity mostly for fMRI. I started to work as a research associate in CUBRIC in September 2017 and currently I am interested in the integration of behavioural models and the neuroimaging (DWI, FMRI and MEG) data and investigation of features in brain connectome that makes people unique.
