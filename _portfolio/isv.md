Connectome of the brain denotes how brain regions are functionally and structurally connected to each other. Connectome is unique to each individual. In this project, we investigate how people differ from each other in their brain connectomes. We measure functional and structural connectome by using neuroimaging techniques and quantify whether these modalities align in explaining individual differences in brain connectome. We also investigate how gender and age influence individual differences.
